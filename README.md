# ListBasedFIFOQueue

This project was made for one of Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology classes. As name suggests, it is an implementation of FIFO queue on a list, but this certain project has a little twist. The list is doubly circular linked with templates whitch allows to store any type of data in it.
